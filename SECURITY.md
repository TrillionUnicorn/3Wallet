# Security Policy

## Overview

3Wallet takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

---

## Security Features

### **1. Encryption**
- **AES-256 encryption** for all private keys
- **Password-based key derivation** using SHA-256
- **Secure random number generation** for mnemonics
- **No server-side key storage** - all keys remain on device

### **2. Key Management**
- **BIP39 standard** for mnemonic generation
- **BIP32 standard** for HD wallet derivation
- **Private keys never transmitted** over network
- **Keys cleared from memory** when wallet is locked

### **3. Password Security**
- **Minimum 8 characters** required
- **Password never stored** anywhere
- **Password used only for encryption/decryption**
- **No password recovery** - users must remember password

### **4. Local Storage**
- **Encrypted data only** stored in localStorage
- **No plain text secrets** in storage
- **Data encrypted before storage**
- **Data cleared on wallet lock**

### **5. Network Security**
- **HTTPS required** for production
- **Security headers** configured
- **No sensitive data in URLs**
- **API keys in environment variables**

## Security Best Practices

### **For Users:**

1. **Strong Password:**
   - Use at least 12 characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't share password with anyone

2. **Recovery Phrase:**
   - Write down your 12-word recovery phrase
   - Store in a secure location (not digital)
   - Never share with anyone
   - Never enter on suspicious websites

3. **Device Security:**
   - Keep your device secure
   - Use antivirus software
   - Don't use on public computers
   - Lock your device when not in use

4. **Network Security:**
   - Use secure internet connection
   - Avoid public WiFi for transactions
   - Use VPN when possible
   - Verify HTTPS in browser

5. **Transaction Safety:**
   - Always verify recipient address
   - Start with small test transactions
   - Double-check amounts
   - Understand gas fees

### **For Developers:**

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` for templates
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use different keys for dev/prod

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Review dependency changes
   - Use lock files

3. **Code Security:**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize user data
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

4. **Deployment:**
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Configure security headers
   - Use environment variables
   - Enable monitoring

## Threat Model

### **What We Protect Against:**

✅ **Network Attacks:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks (HTTPS)
- Packet sniffing (encryption)
- DNS spoofing (HTTPS + HSTS)

✅ **Client-Side Attacks:**
- XSS attacks (Content Security Policy)
- CSRF attacks (SameSite cookies)
- Clickjacking (X-Frame-Options)

✅ **Data Theft:**
- Private key exposure (encryption)
- Password theft (never stored)
- Mnemonic theft (encrypted storage)

### **What We Don't Protect Against:**

❌ **Physical Access:**
- If attacker has physical access to unlocked device
- If user shares password or recovery phrase
- If device is compromised with malware

❌ **User Error:**
- Sending to wrong address
- Losing recovery phrase
- Forgetting password
- Phishing attacks

❌ **Smart Contract Bugs:**
- Bugs in Ethereum smart contracts
- Bitcoin protocol vulnerabilities
- Blockchain network issues
