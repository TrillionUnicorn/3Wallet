## 📱 FRONTEND STACK

### **Browser Extension**

#### **Choice: React + TypeScript + Vite**

**Why React?**
- ✅ Most popular (used by MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby)
- ✅ Huge ecosystem (100K+ packages)
- ✅ Easy to find developers (13M React devs globally)
- ✅ Excellent tooling (React DevTools)
- ✅ Component reusability

**Why TypeScript?**
- ✅ Type safety (critical for crypto)
- ✅ Better IDE support
- ✅ Catch bugs at compile time
- ✅ Industry standard for crypto projects
- ✅ Self-documenting code

**Why Vite?**
- ✅ 10-100x faster than Webpack
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- ✅ Optimized builds
- ✅ Better developer experience

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ Vue: Smaller ecosystem, fewer crypto examples
- ❌ Svelte: Too new for extensions, limited examples
- ❌ Angular: Too heavy for extensions

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ React bundle size larger than Svelte
- ⚠️ Need to optimize for extension size limits (10MB)

**Justification:** React is the proven choice for crypto wallets. MetaMask (30M users), Phantom ($109M funded), and Rabby all use React. The ecosystem and hiring pool make it the safest choice.

---

### **Mobile Apps**

#### **Choice: React Native + TypeScript + Expo**

**Why React Native?**
- ✅ Code sharing with web (70-80% reuse)
- ✅ Single codebase for iOS + Android
- ✅ Native performance
- ✅ Used by Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet
- ✅ Huge community (2.5M developers)

**Why Expo?**
- ✅ Faster development (no native code initially)
- ✅ Over-the-air updates
- ✅ Easier testing
- ✅ Good developer experience

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ Flutter: Dart language (harder to hire)
- ❌ Native (Swift/Kotlin): 2x development cost
- ❌ Ionic: Performance issues

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Slightly larger app size than native
- ⚠️ Some native modules may need custom code

**Justification:** React Native allows us to ship iOS + Android simultaneously with one team. Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet prove it works at scale.

---

### **Desktop Web**

#### **Choice: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**

**Why Next.js?**
- ✅ Best React framework (used by Vercel, Airbnb)
- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO
- ✅ API routes (backend + frontend in one)
- ✅ Image optimization
- ✅ Excellent performance
- ✅ Easy deployment (Vercel)

**Why Tailwind CSS?**
- ✅ Utility-first (faster development)
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Small bundle size (purges unused CSS)
- ✅ Responsive design built-in
- ✅ Already using in current MVP

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ SvelteKit: Current choice, but smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Remix: Newer, less proven
- ❌ Create React App: No SSR, deprecated

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Next.js can be complex for beginners
- ⚠️ Vercel lock-in (but can self-host)

**Justification:** Next.js is the industry standard for React web apps. Vercel (creators of Next.js) has proven infrastructure. SEO is critical for user acquisition.

**Note:** We can keep SvelteKit for MVP, migrate to Next.js for production if needed.

## 🖥️ BACKEND STACK

### **API Server**

#### **Choice: Node.js + Express + TypeScript**

**Why Node.js?**
- ✅ JavaScript everywhere (same language as frontend)
- ✅ Huge ecosystem (2M+ packages)
- ✅ Non-blocking I/O (good for crypto APIs)
- ✅ Easy to find developers
- ✅ Used by Coinbase, Binance

**Why Express?**
- ✅ Most popular Node.js framework

- ❌ Python: Slower, not ideal for real-time

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Single-threaded (but can cluster)
- ⚠️ Callback hell (mitigated with async/await)

**Justification:** Node.js allows code sharing between frontend and backend. Crypto APIs (Alchemy, Infura) have excellent Node.js SDKs.

---

### **Database**

#### **Choice: PostgreSQL + Redis**

**Why PostgreSQL?**
- ✅ Most advanced open-source database
- ✅ ACID compliant (critical for financial data)
- ✅ JSON support (flexible schema)
- ✅ Full-text search
- ✅ Excellent performance
- ✅ Used by Coinbase, Stripe

**Why Redis?**
- ✅ In-memory cache (10-100x faster)
- ✅ Session storage
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Real-time features (pub/sub)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- ❌ MongoDB: No ACID, not ideal for financial data
- ❌ MySQL: Less features than PostgreSQL
- ❌ DynamoDB: AWS lock-in, expensive

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ PostgreSQL can be complex to optimize
- ⚠️ Need to manage two databases

**Justification:** Financial data requires ACID compliance. PostgreSQL is the gold standard. Redis is essential for performance.
